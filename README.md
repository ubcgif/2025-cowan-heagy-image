# Exploring the influence of various transfer functions on airborne magnetotelluric inversion

Airborne magnetotelluric (AirMT) systems generate transfer
function data from magnetic fields measured in the air, and either
electric or magnetic fields measured at a base station. The
data collected during an AirMT survey is system-dependent
and can be generated using one or more directional components
of the magnetic field measured in the air. Data collected
by various AirMT systems may not produce the same diagnostic
anomalies, and may not recover the same conductivity
model when inverted using the same inversion hyperparameters.
We use numerical forward simulation to analyze the
transfer function data that can be generated from 3-component
airborne magnetic field measurements. Our analysis indicates
that the shape, amplitude and/or phase of AirMT anomalies
can be measurably influenced by 3D structure at the base station,
regardless of whether data are collected using an electric
or magnetic base station. We invert AirMT data to recover a
conductivity model using four separate sets of transfer function
data, where all inversions use identical hyperparameters.
For a remote base station, the locations and depths of structures
within the region of interest are recovered consistently
for all sets of transfer functions. However different transfer
function data, when inverted, may recover different structures
within the region of interest and/or near the base station.
